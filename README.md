##  Entries
        
 The entries page is the interface for adding foods to the current
day or any other date, you have the options to add food to 4
different meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks. You can drag
foods between meals and make your own recipes! After you have
created a recipe add it to your meals or favorite it and access it
easily!

Adding recipes is meant to be used for

or cooking larger meals multiple times a day which are split into
portions. For example making a meal with 1kg of chicken breast,
vegetables, 500 g of rice, olive oil, etc. and splitting it into 4
portions. This way you can control your portion size with the same
number of calories in every meal and prepare food in advance! It is
advisable to purchase a kitchen scale for best results with meal
prepping.
